The Schematic Web Viewer is a web app which loads .schematic files (or similar formatted) and displays the results graphically.
Its a work in progress but has some basic blocks rendered from public Minecraft resource packs.

[Try it out](http://dontsnooze.github.io/SchematicWebViewer/)

Need a schematic file to try it with? Check the [schematics folder in the repo](https://github.com/DontSnooze/SchematicWebViewer/tree/main/Schematics) or direct download one [here](https://github.com/DontSnooze/SchematicWebViewer/raw/main/Schematics/AmosBedrockCowFarmV2.schematic)

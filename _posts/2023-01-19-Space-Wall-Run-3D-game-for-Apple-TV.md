Space Wall Run is a 3D game for the Apple TV built with Swift. The objective is to stear your ship through the walls of bricks by avoiding or shooting bricks out. Blue tinted bricks can be destroyed. Black tinted bricks cannot be destroyed. You gain points by destroying bricks and lose lives if you're ship hits a brick.

Space Wall Run

Space Wall Run is a 3D game for the Apple TV built with Swift. The objective is to stear your ship through the walls of bricks by avoiding or shooting bricks out. Blue bricks can be destroyed. The dark gray bricks cannot be destroyed. You gain points by shooting bricks and lose lives if you're ship hits a brick.
